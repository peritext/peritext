  description="When we read literature and look at images on pages or screens, we are usually trying to extract information from words, symbols and figures. We donâ€™t often think about the physical processes involved in this or even the material objects with which we are interacting: we seem to see through the paper pages and the illuminated computer screens, barely registering differences between media as we work out the messages being transmitted through them. Yet the material properties of different media have all sorts of subtle effects on our reading and viewing experiences. For example, the way that the cover of a book feels or looks can determine whether we pick it up and enjoy reading it, and the brightness and speed of electronic images can determine whether we stay on one site or click our way to another."
