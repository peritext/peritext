![A reference](@temporal_data){@cool_timeline}

![Another view on the timeline](@temporal_data){@cool_timeline,
    startat="2012-21-01"
}


I will talk about that[^]{with a footnote here} :

![Another reference with unnamed contextualizer](@temporal_data){
    type="timeline",
    layer={layertype=events,data=@res.data.dates,labels=@res.data.labels},
    title="My title"
}

I will first quote in a book where someone that says [it's not possible](@ab94).


Then I should have an ibid here [^]{[](@ab94){page="12"}.}

And as say a lot of people[^]{[](@martin_change_2002){pages="30-40"}}, publishing could be simpler.

And for the footnotes, I want to say that Martin said that[^]{I'm referencing to [](@martin_change_2002){pages="12-13"} when he says : "hello"}

Whe Martin says [there has to be some *change*](@martin_change_2002).

Now let's say I want to link to this [timeline](@temporal_data){
    type="timeline",
    layer={dates=@res.data.dates,labels=@res.data.labels},
    layer={dates=@res.data.dates,labels=@res.data.labels},
    caption="This is a text with {stuf} but it should work"
} and continue my paragraph quietly.

Welcome to my awesome book.

Thanks to all !

I am just there, not linked to ``content.md``. I should be put at the end of content by alphabetical order.
